### Monitoring vs. Observability: Why You Need Both to Build Reliable Systems

As an SRE, I see monitoring and observability as partners in building reliable systems.
Some people mix them up, but they do differ in important ways.


🔗**Similarities:**

- Both improve system reliability.
- Both collect and analyze system data.
- Both help detect and resolve issues.

📍**Differences:**

✅ Monitoring: Tracks known metrics, alerts you something is wrong.\
🔍 Observability: Explains what’s wrong, why, and where, even for unknown issues.

When the same problem keeps recurring without a clear cause, monitoring alone falls short — observability digs deeper to find root causes.

✔️Monitoring detects.\
✔️Observability investigates.\
✔️Together, they keep systems resilient.


**Nagios/Zabbix**: Track system health, detect failures, and alert based on predefined metrics = **Monitoring**\
**Prometheus-Grafana/ELK/Datadog** : Provide deep insights into what, why, and where something is wrong—includes metrics, logs, and traces = **Observability**
