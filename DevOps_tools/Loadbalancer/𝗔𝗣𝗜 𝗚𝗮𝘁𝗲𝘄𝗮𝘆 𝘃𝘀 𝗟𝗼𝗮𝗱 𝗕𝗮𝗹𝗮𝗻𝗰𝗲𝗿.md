👉 API Gateway: Routes requests to the correct microservice.
👉 Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across healthy instances.

An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for clients in a microservices architecture. It essentially functions as a "postman," routing requests to the correct microservices.

It also handles:

- Authentication
- Rate Limiting
- Load Balancing
- Response Caching

Pros:
✅ Simplifies Client API
✅ Centralized Security
✅ Supports Microservices

Cons:
❌ Single Point of Failure
❌ Increased Complexity
❌ Performance Bottleneck
❌ Maintenance Overhead

A Load Balancer, on the other hand, distributes client requests to different instances (servers) of the same service.

This ensures no single server for a service becomes overwhelmed.
It achieves this through several algorithms, including:

- Round Robin
- IP Hash
- Least Connections
- Least Response Time

Pros:
✅ Improved Scalability
✅ High Availability
✅ Efficient Resource Utilization
✅ Fault Tolerance

Cons:
❌ Single Point of Failure
❌ Added Complexity
❌ Implementation Cost
❌ Potential Latency

When to Use Which?

API Gateway:

✅ Microservices Architecture
✅ Unified API for Clients
✅ Protocol Translation

Load Balancer:

✅ Distribute traffic among identical servers
✅ Enhance availability
✅ Balance network load

Many systems use both a Load Balancer and an API Gateway. Netflix, for example, receives all its client requests through an API Gateway called "Zuul." 

After passing through Zuul, requests are forwarded to load balancers, which distribute them among instances of microservices.
